										<h2>THE TRUST MACHINE</h2>
									</header>
									<p>THE TRUST MACHINE will be a feature length documentary film about blockchain technology. Blockchain is the technology that enables the secure distributed sharing of records. Bitcoin and other digital currencies have been made possible by blockchain protocols. The architecture enables people to connect in ways that have never been possible before and solutions based on this technology are rapidly finding their way into all areas of society. This innovation is being described as being as significant as the invention of the Internet itself.

										A blockchain eliminates the need for centralized gatekeepers and connects everyone to everyone else. Eliminating or reducing intermediaries and inefficiencies. Systems can be created for the benefit of everyone. But there are significant technological, political and societal challenges to achieve this.
										
										Fundamentally, blockchains are about trust - they enable trust between people, companies, organisations and other entities - where previously this trust was enabled through centralised intermediaries.
										
										THE TRUST MACHINE will investigate how blockchain protocols are being used and how this will affect all of us.
